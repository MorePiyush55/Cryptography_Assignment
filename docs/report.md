## Abstract

This report presents a comprehensive cryptographic protocol designed for secure property transactions between remote parties, specifically addressing the requirements of Hackit & Run LLP (H&R) for facilitating land purchases between Mrs. Harvey (buyer) and Mr. L.M. Facey (seller). The protocol implements a hybrid encryption system combining RSA-2048 and AES-256 algorithms, providing confidentiality, integrity, authenticity, and non-repudiation while ensuring compliance with UK Electronic Communications Act 2000 and Electronic Signatures Regulations 2002. The solution addresses both first-time communications and established relationships between solicitors, offering a scalable and legally enforceable framework for remote property transactions.

## 1. Introduction

The increasing digitalization of legal services, accelerated by global mobility and remote working practices, has created an urgent need for secure electronic document exchange systems in property law. Traditional property transactions rely heavily on physical presence and paper-based documentation, creating significant barriers when parties are geographically distributed. This challenge is exemplified by the case of Mrs. Harvey attempting to purchase land from Mr. L.M. Facey, where both parties' mobility prevents conventional transaction completion.

Hackit & Run LLP (H&R), recognizing the competitive necessity of adapting to modern transaction methods, requires a comprehensive system that maintains legal enforceability while enabling remote contract exchange. The system must accommodate the tripartite communication structure inherent in UK property law, where solicitors act as intermediaries, and must provide different protocols for established and new professional relationships.

The primary objectives of this protocol are to ensure secure contract transmission from the seller's solicitor to H&R, protected forwarding to Mrs. Harvey, legally binding digital signature capture, and secure return delivery to the seller's solicitor. The system must satisfy stringent security requirements including confidentiality of sensitive property details, integrity protection against document tampering, authentication of all parties, and non-repudiation to prevent transaction denial.

## 2. Literature Review and Theoretical Foundation

### 2.1 Legal Framework

The UK Electronic Communications Act 2000 established the legal foundation for electronic signatures, stating that electronic signatures satisfying prescribed conditions are admissible in legal proceedings and have the same legal effect as handwritten signatures. The Electronic Signatures Regulations 2002 further defined advanced electronic signatures, requiring unique creation data under the signatory's sole control, detectability of subsequent changes, and reliable identification of the signatory.

Recent case law, including *Bassano v Toft* [2014] EWHC 377, has reinforced that electronic signatures can constitute valid execution of documents where there is clear intention to authenticate the document. This legal precedent supports the use of cryptographic digital signatures in property transactions, provided they meet technical and procedural requirements.

### 2.2 Cryptographic Foundations

Public key cryptography, introduced by Diffie and Hellman (1976), provides the theoretical foundation for secure communication between parties without prior shared secrets. RSA, developed by Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman (1978), remains the most widely deployed public key algorithm due to its mathematical foundation in integer factorization and extensive legal recognition.

The RSA-PSS signature scheme, standardized in PKCS #1 v2.1, provides provable security against existential forgery under chosen message attacks, making it superior to earlier PKCS #1 v1.5 signatures for new applications. The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), adopted by NIST in 2001, provides efficient symmetric encryption with no known practical attacks against its 256-bit variant.

Hybrid encryption systems combine the security properties of public key cryptography with the performance advantages of symmetric encryption. This approach, widely used in protocols like TLS and PGP, generates unique symmetric keys for each message while using public key cryptography for key exchange and authentication.

## 3. Protocol Design and Architecture

### 3.1 System Architecture

The protocol implements a hub-and-spoke architecture with H&R serving as the central communication node. This design reflects the legal reality of UK property transactions where H&R acts as Mrs. Harvey's representative and must verify all documentation before client signature. The architecture prevents direct communication between Mrs. Harvey and the seller's solicitor, maintaining professional boundaries and enabling H&R to fulfill their duty of care.

```
┌─────────────────┐      ┌─────────────────┐      ┌─────────────────┐
│ Seller's        │◄────►│       H&R       │◄────►│  Mrs. Harvey    │
│ Solicitor       │      │  (Central Hub)  │      │   (Buyer)       │
└─────────────────┘      └─────────────────┘      └─────────────────┘
```

Each party maintains an RSA-2048 key pair, with private keys secured locally and public keys distributed through a trust network. The protocol supports both Certificate Authority validation and out-of-band verification for public key authenticity, accommodating different risk tolerance levels and existing professional relationships.

### 3.2 Communication Scenarios

#### 3.2.1 First-Time Communication
When H&R and the seller's solicitor communicate for the first time, the protocol implements full public key exchange with enhanced verification procedures. This includes out-of-band confirmation of public key fingerprints, establishment of shared authentication parameters, and creation of audit trails for future reference. The enhanced procedure addresses the cold-start problem in public key infrastructure while maintaining security against man-in-the-middle attacks.

#### 3.2.2 Established Relationships
For solicitors with previous secure communication history, the protocol provides streamlined authentication using previously verified public keys and established trust relationships. This reduces transaction overhead while maintaining security through continued signature verification and message authentication.

### 3.3 Protocol Phases

#### Phase 1: Party Initialization
Each participant generates an RSA-2048 key pair using cryptographically secure random number generation. Private keys are stored with appropriate access controls, while public keys are prepared for distribution. Key generation follows FIPS 186-4 standards, ensuring adequate entropy and mathematical properties required for security.

#### Phase 2: Secure Channel Establishment
The protocol establishes encrypted communication channels between H&R and each external party. For first-time communications, this includes comprehensive public key verification, while established relationships use simplified authentication procedures. Session parameters are negotiated to ensure compatibility and optimal security.

#### Phase 3: Contract Transmission
The seller's solicitor creates the property purchase contract and prepares it for secure transmission. The document undergoes SHA-256 hashing for integrity verification, followed by RSA-PSS signature creation for authentication and non-repudiation. The complete package is encrypted using hybrid encryption (AES-256 + RSA-OAEP) for transmission to H&R.

#### Phase 4: Contract Forwarding
H&R receives and verifies the contract from the seller's solicitor, checking both the digital signature and document integrity. Upon successful verification, H&R creates a cover message with instructions for Mrs. Harvey and forwards the contract using the same hybrid encryption approach. This stage implements H&R's duty to review and explain contract terms to their client.

#### Phase 5: Contract Signing
Mrs. Harvey receives the encrypted contract, verifies its authenticity, and reviews the terms. Upon acceptance, she creates a legally binding digital signature using RSA-PSS, which includes metadata specifying her intent to be bound by the contract terms. The signed contract is encrypted and returned to H&R with confirmation of acceptance.

#### Phase 6: Final Delivery
H&R receives the signed contract, verifies Mrs. Harvey's signature, and confirms the legal binding nature of the signature. The completed contract is then forwarded to the seller's solicitor with verification confirmation, completing the secure exchange process.

## 4. Cryptographic Algorithm Selection and Justification

### 4.1 RSA-2048 for Asymmetric Operations

RSA-2048 was selected for digital signatures and key exchange based on its unique combination of security, legal recognition, and interoperability. The 2048-bit key size provides approximately 112 bits of security according to NIST SP 800-57, remaining secure until 2030 under current threat assessments. This timeframe exceeds typical property transaction timelines, ensuring long-term signature validity.

Legal recognition was a primary selection criterion, as RSA signatures have extensive precedent in UK courts and are explicitly recognized under European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) specifications for qualified electronic signatures. The algorithm's widespread adoption ensures compatibility with existing legal and technical infrastructure.

The protocol implements RSA-PSS for signatures rather than PKCS #1 v1.5 due to its provable security properties. RSA-PSS provides tight security reductions and resistance to existential forgery attacks, making it suitable for high-stakes legal applications. For encryption, RSA-OAEP provides chosen ciphertext attack resistance, essential for protecting symmetric keys in hybrid encryption.

### 4.2 AES-256-CBC for Symmetric Encryption

AES-256 was chosen for bulk encryption due to its exceptional security properties and performance characteristics. The 256-bit key size provides 128 bits of effective security, exceeding current and foreseeable cryptanalytic capabilities. NIST's confidence in AES-256 for protecting classified information up to TOP SECRET level demonstrates its suitability for commercial property transactions.

Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode was selected over alternatives like Electronic Codebook (ECB) due to its semantic security properties with random initialization vectors. While authenticated encryption modes like GCM provide additional security guarantees, the protocol implements authentication through digital signatures, making CBC's simplicity and universal support advantageous.

Each message uses a unique 256-bit AES key generated through cryptographically secure random number generation, providing forward secrecy. If long-term RSA keys are compromised, previously transmitted messages remain protected by their unique symmetric keys.

### 4.3 SHA-256 for Cryptographic Hashing

SHA-256 provides cryptographic hashing for document integrity and signature generation. Its 256-bit output provides 128 bits of preimage resistance and collision resistance, with no known practical attacks against the full algorithm. The hash function's efficiency enables real-time document verification without performance impact.

SHA-256 is required for RSA-PSS signatures and is universally supported across cryptographic libraries and legal frameworks. Its inclusion in FIPS 180-4 and widespread adoption in financial and legal systems ensures long-term viability and recognition.

## 5. Security Analysis

### 5.1 Threat Model

The protocol addresses multiple threat categories relevant to property transactions:

**Passive Attacks**: Network eavesdropping is mitigated through AES-256 encryption, making intercepted communications computationally infeasible to decrypt. Traffic analysis provides minimal intelligence due to encryption of metadata and communication patterns.

**Active Attacks**: Man-in-the-middle attacks are prevented through RSA digital signature verification and public key authentication. Message tampering is detected through SHA-256 integrity checks and signature verification.

**Insider Threats**: Key compromise by malicious insiders is contained through individual key pairs and compartmentalized access. Complete protocol compromise requires simultaneous compromise of multiple parties' private keys.

**Repudiation Attacks**: Legal denial of participation is prevented through RSA-PSS digital signatures with comprehensive metadata including timestamps, jurisdiction declarations, and intent statements.

### 5.2 Security Properties

#### Confidentiality
AES-256 encryption ensures that contract contents remain confidential even under quantum computer threats for the foreseeable future. Hybrid encryption provides forward secrecy, protecting past communications even if long-term keys are compromised.

#### Integrity
SHA-256 hashes detect any modification to contract content, while RSA-PSS signatures provide cryptographic proof of document authenticity. The combination ensures both bit-level integrity and semantic authenticity.

#### Authentication
RSA digital signatures provide strong authentication of message origins, while public key infrastructure ensures identity binding. The protocol prevents impersonation attacks through cryptographic verification of sender identity.

#### Non-repudiation
RSA-PSS signatures with legal metadata provide non-repudiable proof of agreement. The signatures meet UK legal requirements for electronic signatures and are admissible as evidence in court proceedings.

## 6. Implementation and Technical Considerations

### 6.1 Key Management

Secure key generation utilizes cryptographically secure random number generators meeting FIPS 140-2 Level 3 requirements. Private keys are protected using operating system access controls and encrypted storage where appropriate. Public key distribution employs both technical verification (fingerprint checking) and procedural verification (out-of-band confirmation) to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks during initial key exchange.

### 6.2 Message Format

The protocol employs structured JSON formatting for interoperability and future extensibility. Binary cryptographic data is encoded using Base64 for safe transmission across text-based communication channels. Message versioning enables protocol evolution while maintaining backward compatibility.
